## Quick start

To edit documentation:

- Clone/use [new project template](https://github.com/majkinetor/mm-docs-template)
- Add new documents somewhere in the `source\docs` hierarchy.
- Add document path to TOC (file: `source\mkdocs.yml`; yaml key: `nav`) to make page visible in the navigation section, otherwise, the page is available via direct link.

Start development server - run in PowerShell `Invoke-Build Run`. The command is syntax sugar for running docker containers.
To build static site run `Invoke-Build Build`.
